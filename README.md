Rust implementations of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm 

Current implementations:
+ Original version
+ Version using pivot
+ Version using degeneracy ordering
+ Iterative versions of the three above
+ Parallel versions of the three recursive implementations (top parallelism using [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon))
+ Parallel versions of the three recursive implementations (full parallelism using [threadpool](https://github.com/rust-threadpool/rust-threadpool))
+ Distributed versions of the two first recursive implementations (mpi using [rsmpi](https://github.com/rsmpi/rsmpi))

# Usage
```
Find maximal cliques using different algorithms

USAGE:
    cliques-rs [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -v, --verbose    
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -a, --algorithm <alg>...      Choose which algorithm to run [possible values: BK-Basic, BK-BasicWithPivot, BK-
                                  BasicWithOrdering, BK-BasicIterative, BK-BasicIterWithPivot, BK-
                                  BasicIterWithOrdering, BK-BasicParallel, BK-BasicParWithPivot, BK-
                                  BasicParWithOrdering, BK-BasicPool, BK-BasicPoolWithPivot]
    -i, --input-file <FILE>       Set input-file. Use STDIN if absent
    -k, --max-cliques <number>    Search maximum cliques of specific size
    -t, --threads <number>        Choose number of threads (> 0) for compatible algorithms (Defaults to number of
                                  processor cores)

```

Input data should be a list of edges separated by tabulations:
```
NODE_ID\tOTHER_NODE_ID
```
